    <p>The clubs found in SPAS provide a wide range of fun and meaningful extracurricular activities for every student to enjoy. From clubs that represent the school in different sports to clubs that help the learner discover their passions. SPAS also has clubs that help the student go deeper in their devotions to God. Clubs that are all moderated by passionate teachers that want to give each learner fun and meaningful tasks to complete in each club meeting. The Club meetings are held after class at respective classrooms or rooms to facilitate each club accordingly.</p>
