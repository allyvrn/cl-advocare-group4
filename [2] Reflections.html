That’s why I plan to use these talents for good and to help others. My art is not only a means for me to express myself, but also a way to send messages that resonate with many. The value in my artworks isn’t only in price, but also in’s impact on the viewer. I may sell artworks for money, and I am just as happy to give them away or use the proceeds to buy food and give it to the poor. However, I want my artworks to also leave a lasting impact and teach people the beauty of art. I hope to someday inspire people to do the same. Raising a community of artists that supports each other, not only to improve their skills but also to help those who are poor and hungry, too.");

As our group advocates for positive social change, especially in addressing poverty and hunger, I recognize how important it is to use these gifts to help others who are experiencing hardship. God has blessed me with qualities like being flexible, a good listener, physically capable, and curious about the world through astronomy. These strengths allow me to understand people better, adapt to their needs, and offer support in simple but meaningful ways. I also acknowledge that my talents, even the simple ones like sports, sleeping, and eating, still reflect parts of who I am and how I can connect with others. My skill of being honest and transparent helps me build trust and communicate openly, which is important when working with a group that aims to serve others. I know that not everyone has been given the same opportunities, especially those living in poverty, and I want to use what I have to help make their lives better. By contributing to the goals of SDG 1 and SDG 2, I hope to repay God’s kindness by showing compassion, understanding, and genuine care through my actions. I should share my gifts with others, particularly those in need of support, hope, and kindness, rather than keeping them to myself. Through our CLVE group, I will use these blessings to make even small contributions toward a better world, trusting that God can turn small efforts into meaningful change.");

Music can capture attention in ways words sometimes cannot, helping highlight the realities faced by those in poverty. I can use my performances to raise funds, support community programs, or bring awareness to campaigns. By collaborating with organizations, I can turn each piece I play into a reminder of our shared responsibility to help others. Using my music with intention allows my talent to contribute to hope, empowerment, and change.");

The advocacy for positive social change is what my group intends to help others, especially those affected by poverty and hunger. I was given the privilege by God to be born in a financially stable family, allowing me to never experience poverty or hunger. The objective of our group is to help achieve the goals of SDG 1 and SDG 2, which are two of the most common problems in the Philippines, and helping achieve this goal will lead to a better life in the Philippines, no matter how big or small the contribution may be. I would like to repay God’s kindness by helping others who are in unfortunate circumstances and sharing with them who God is and what He is like through the actions of our CLVE group. I will help others with the gifts that God has given me because these gifts weren’t given to me just so I could waste them, but so that I could help other people. For my talent of swimming, although I no longer compete in it, I will promote the ways of striving for no poverty and no hunger by sharing to them the ideas of the two SDGs, that they may help in the objective of striving for a better world.

My determination enables me to take initiative during events, organize tasks, and remain committed to long-term efforts, such as feeding programs and sustainable fundraising initiatives. My generosity allows me to offer my time, resources, and care by volunteering in community visits, distributing meals, and sharing essentials with families in need. My singing and dancing can inspire and bring joy to others through mini crowdfunding concerts, benefit performances, and collaborations that raise funds and awareness, which in turn creates engaging advocacy content that encourages others to contribute to positive change as well. With these gifts, I am committed to going above and beyond to help those who are in need, malnourished, and facing hardship, utilizing the traits and talents God has entrusted to me to create genuine and impactful change.");

Because of this, I recognize that the blessings I have been given are meant to be shared and used not only for my own growth, but also for the good of others. My strengths as a quick learner, being focus-driven, and my ability to adapt easily allow me to understand new situations and respond to challenges with determination. My talents in memory and mathematics, along with my skills in problem-solving, public speaking, and language learning, show that I have the courage to explore unfamiliar things and take the first steps in areas that require both critical thinking and communication. These qualities are especially important when advocating for the issue of poverty, where meaningful action requires empathy, openness, and the ability to analyze problems while sharing information clearly. By using my abilities to listen, learn, and communicate effectively, I can contribute to raising awareness and supporting efforts that help uplift individuals and communities affected by poverty.");

My strengths as a quick-thinker, fast learner, and someone who stays calm under pressure help me respond to the needs of communities in difficult situations, and my ability to listen allows me to understand their experiences with empathy. I can use my talents in crocheting, sewing, and editing as tools for empowerment-whether by teaching basic livelihood skills, creating handmade items to sell on donation drives, or producing media that raises awareness about poverty and hunger. With skills in public speaking, graphic design and multitasking, I can help organize campaigns, create informative materials, and encourage others to take action. I know I cannot solve these issues alone, but I can use what I have to support programs that provide food, opportunities, and hope. Through small acts of service and advocacy, I can contribute to building a community where fewer families struggle and where everyone has a chance to live with dignity");

I’ve realized that strengths are shaped by both what others see in you and what you discover within yourself. I may not have many talents or skills I’m fully aware of, but one thing I am sure I possess is the ability to adapt. I’ve learned to bend without breaking, to stay steady even when everything around me shifts, and to remain grounded in situations that once would have overwhelmed me. This adaptability didn’t simply appear. It grew from moments where change was the only option. Each challenge taught me that being adaptable isn’t about pretending life is easy, but about being willing to learn, stay open, and keep moving. Over time, I’ve come to see this ability as more than a skill. It is a gift God placed in me so I could navigate His path with purpose and resilience. Now, as I look beyond myself, I realize that this God-given adaptability isn’t just for my own survival. It is the very strength that enables me to make meaningful contributions to the world’s biggest challenges, including the Sustainable Development Goals, where the future belongs to those who know how to adapt, uplift, and transform.");
