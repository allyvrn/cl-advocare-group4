    <p>Why We Chose Poverty: <br><br>
We chose to focus on Metro Manila and poverty because the country has one of the largest Christian populations in the world. Many Filipinos grow up with strong faith-based teachings about compassion, generosity, and helping those in need. However, despite these shared beliefs, social problems such as poverty, inequality, and neglect of the poor continue to exist. This contrast between widely practiced religious values and ongoing social challenges highlights the need for deeper action, not just faith in words. Our advocacy aims to encourage communities to live out these values by supporting and uplifting those who are most vulnerable. 
Recent Data & Trends on Poverty in Metro Manila (2023–2024)
Official Poverty Incidence (PSA)
<br><br>

According to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), the poverty incidence among families in NCR (Metro Manila) in 2023 was 1.1%. 
The poverty threshold for a 5-member family in NCR was ₱15,713/month in 2023.
<br><br>

In terms of depth of poverty: the “poverty gap” (how far poor families are from the threshold, on average) decreased from 3.0% in 2021 to 2.2% in 2023.Self-Rated Poverty (SWS)
<br><br>

In December 2024, 51% of Metro Manila families rated themselves as poor.
<br><br>

The “self-rated poverty threshold” (how much monthly money people think they need to not be “poor”) was ₱20,000/month for Metro Manila in December 2024.
<br><br>

The “self-rated poverty gap” for Metro Manila was ₱7,000/month — meaning many poor self-rated families say they lack that much to reach what they consider a non-poor income. 
Annual average self-rated poverty for 2024 was 57%, which is 9 percentage points higher than the 2023 and 2022 averages (48%) according to SWS.
<br><br>

In the first quarter of 2024 (March), a different SWS survey showed 33% of Metro Manila families (self-rated) considered themselves poor. 
Hunger / Food Poverty
<br><br>

According to SWS (Dec 2024), 39% of Metro Manila families rated themselves as “food-poor” (i.e., they consider their food situation insufficient).
<br><br>

According to an OCTA Research “Tugon ng Masa” survey in March 2024: 9% of Metro Manila families reported involuntary hunger in the prior three months.
<br><br><br>


Interpretation / Analysis
There is a big gap between official poverty incidence (very low, 1.1%) and self-rated poverty (much higher, ~50%+). This suggests that many Metro Manila families feel “poor” by their own standard, even if they are above the government’s poverty line.
<br><br>

The high self-rated poverty threshold (₱20,000) shows that many Metro Manila residents feel the cost of living is high: what they consider a “non-poor” income is much higher than the official poverty line.
<br><br>

The self-rated poverty gap (₱7,000) indicates that many families believe they are significantly short of what they need for a minimally acceptable standard of living (according to themselves).
<br><br>

Although the official poverty rate is low, self-rated data show persistent feelings of economic insecurity or vulnerability — especially in terms of food (39% say they are food-poor).
<br><br>

The drop in the poverty gap (official) from 2021 to 2023 suggests some improvement in how deeply poor families fall below the poverty threshold, but the self-rated data complicate the picture: “feeling poor” is not just about being below a fixed line — many worse-off or “near poor” households might still feel very insecure.
